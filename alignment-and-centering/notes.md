<b>justify-content</b> is where content is aligned on the main axis (default left to right).
Options:
 1. `flex-start` (default)
 2. `flex-end` (pack all to end)
 3. `space-between` (items are evenly distributed in the line)
 4. `space-around` (Note that visually the spaces arenâ€™t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides, meaning start and end have 1x space, but space between is 2x space, one for each flex item)
 5. `center` 

<b>align-items</b> defines content on the cross axis. Remember that it takes the vertical center of the container, not the viewport, so you need to have container class have `height: 100vh` in order to vertically align.
 1. `center`
 2. `stretch`
 3. `flex-start` (default)
 4. `flex-end` (pack all to end)
 5. `baseline` (make sure the bottom of the text is all aligned properly when they are different sizes)

 For `align-content` you need to have some sort of wrap or it doesn't take effect. We are only concerned with the cross axis here.

<b>align-self</b> can override the rest of `align-items`, helpful if you want to just stretch one item, or put just one item at the start or end.
